Problems keys - 
CartPole-v1 -> cp
Acrobot-v1 -> acro
MountainCarContinuous-v0 -> mcc

Q1 -
To run AC, execute script q1 when the first argument is the wanted problem's key, for example - "python3 q1.py acro".

Q2 - 
To run auto tune on problem and change problem after convergence, execute script when first arg is the source problem's key and the second is the target's key, for example - "python3 q2.py acro cp" will train Acrobot until convergence and switch to Cartpole. 

Q3 - 
To run PNN, execute script when first tow args is the source problems' key and the third is the target's key, for example - "python3 q3.py acro mcc cp " will build the PNN when Acrobot and MountainCarContinuous are the first two columns of PNN which are trained, and the third is of Cartpole which will be trained.
