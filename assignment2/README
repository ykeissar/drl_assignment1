Each of the programs - 'policy_gradients_q1.py', 'policy_gradients_q2.py'
have 3 running modes, determine by the first commandline argument, by executing - "python <program_name.py> <1/2/3>".
Modes -
1) Will run algorithm one iteration of algorithm, will plot losses and print episode number and time to convergence.
   This is the default run if no choice was made.

2) Will run algorithm multiple times, will print mean time to converge and mean episode counts.
   Number of iterations my be argument - ""python <program_name.py> 2 <#ITERS>" or default N_ITERS value.

3) Will preform hyper-parameters tuning.
